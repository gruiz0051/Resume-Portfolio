        <p class ="about">Hello, I am Galilea. I am a second year ICAM student at the Univerity of California, San Diego. I am intrested in pursing a career in the UI/UX field because I enjoy thinking about how design can be used to solve user problems. Creating user-friendly interfaces is important because I have encountred webisite layouts that were difficult to navigate and I believe users should have an easy experince when it comes to digital tools.</p>

            <p class ="dice-summary-text"> My task was to ask the user to input the amount of times they would like to play, keep track of the money balance, and improve the overall styling. I had a bit of trouble figuring out how to create a loop, but after a bit of trial and error I realized all I had to do was call functions.

    <p class="cssi-summary"> Summary:</p>
    <p class="cssi-summary-text"> During the intensive summer session, my group and I were tasked with learning HTML,CSS,and JavaScript.The end goal was to create our own program. We decided to create Space Cats: Into the Dog-plex,a space invaders inspired game with a twist. The mission is to save your owner from adopting a dog, you get launched into space by the MEOW to prevent these aliens from invading your home. One issue I was faced with as a beginner to JavaScript was learning about vectors, since we wanted it to be a shooter games.Although I did not quite get it the first time around, I plan to revist this project and make improvements of my own.
